To benchmark on Centaurus
1. Pull Git repository
2. run "make" in the "par-graphcrawler" directory to compile the code
3. run "sbatch par_batch_script.sh" to run the code through slurm. Use the following rules for command line arguments

    Use the following arguments to run on command line:
    Arg 1: (string) Name of initial node. If the name contains spaces, you will need to use quotation marks
    Arg 2: (int) Maximum depth of search
    Arg 3: (int) Number of threads to run with

    For example: sbatch par_batch_script.sh "Tom Hanks" 2 8
    Use seq_batch_script.sh to run in sequential, omitting the thread count argument

4. The execution time will be printed to the console. cat the slurm file to view
