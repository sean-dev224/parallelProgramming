To benchmark on Centaurus
1. Pull Git repository
2. run "make" in the "seq-nbody" directory to compile the code
3. run "sbatch batch_script.sh" to run the code through slurm. Use the following rules for command line arguments

    Arg 1: either an integer representing the number of particles (for a random initialization), or a path to an initial state (such as solar.tsv)
    Arg 2: (string) filepath to an output tsv file. The program will create it if it doesn't exist, or overwrite if it does
    Arg 3: (double) delta T for each step of the simulation
    Arg 4: (int) number of timesteps for the simulation
    Arg 5: (int) how frequently to write the state. The simulation will write every n timesteps

    For example: sbatch batch_script.sh solar.tsv output2.tsv 10000 1000 10

4. The execution time will be written to the console. cat the slurm output to see it
5. on a development machine, run plot.py with the path to the output tsv file as a command line argument. This will visualize the simulation


Simulation Execution Times
Solar system with dt=200, steps=5000000: 1.05232e+06ms
100 partcles with dt=1 steps=10000: 186921ms
1000 particles with dt=1 and steps=10000: 1.83846e+07ms
