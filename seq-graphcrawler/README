To benchmark on Centaurus
1. Pull Git repository
2. run "make" in the "seq-graphcrawler" directory to compile the code
3. run "sbatch batch_script.sh" to run the code through slurm. Use the following rules for command line arguments

    Use the following arguments to run on command line:
    Arg 1: (string) Name of initial node. If the name contains spaces, you will need to use quotation marks
    Arg 2: (int) Maximum depth of search
    Arg 3: (string) Filepath of output (use .txt)

    For example: sbatch batch_script.sh "Tom Hanks" 2 TomHanks_depth=2.txt

4. The execution time and graph contents will be store in the generated .txt file
